<h1>Sentiment Analysis Program in C++</h1>
<p>This is a C++ program that performs sentiment analysis on text data. The program uses a dictionary of words, each of which has a sentiment value assigned to it, to determine the overall sentiment of the text. The program can also allow users to add new words to the dictionary and assign them their own sentiment values. In addition, the program has a GUI interface to make it easier to use.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use the program, simply clone the repository to your local machine and compile the code. The program should work on any standard C++ compiler.</p>
<h2>Using the Program</h2>
<p>The program takes input in the form of text data, either from a file or through the console. The program then analyzes the text and provides an overall sentiment value based on the words in the text.</p>
<p>To add new words to the dictionary, the user can enter them into the program and assign them a sentiment value. The program will then update the dictionary with the new words and their assigned values.</p>
<p>The program also has a GUI interface that makes it easier to use. The GUI allows the user to input text, add new words to the dictionary, and view the sentiment analysis results.</p>
<h2>Dictionary</h2>
<p>The program uses a text-based dictionary that contains around 3000 words, each with a sentiment value assigned to it. The sentiment values range from -5 (very negative) to +5 (very positive), with 0 being neutral.</p>
<p>The dictionary is stored in a text file, which can be easily updated by the user. The format of the file is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>word,sentiment_value
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>happy,4
sad,-3
</code></pre>
